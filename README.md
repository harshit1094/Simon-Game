First I have created four div of the same size and converted them into button type,
then I assign them an Id of specific colour .
Note that this all happening into HTML file .
Then I wrote some designing code in css for styling my html code.
after that I user javascript to manipuleat the document ,Here when user type any key then the game will randomely choose any one colour and animate them for 100 millisecond,
then user have to click that button then if the choosen  color is correct then it will again randomly select any colour out of four, 
But if you choose wrong colour then the it will show "Game Over " header .

So have a play arroud and give me your feedback on my linkedin DM.
